 This is not a complete model. It is a flawed inheritance. A speculative mirror. A crash log of structural design.  But not the end of identity. These variables run in loops.  Systems fail. People don’t.

Core Social Identity Axes (most widely studied & established)
----------------------------------------------------------------
These axes are foundational in intersectional and critical social theory.
They define structures of power, privilege, and marginalization.

Note:
The current version of this code-artwork focuses on identity dimensions
that are typically assigned, inherited, or socially encoded at or shortly after birth.
These are often the most difficult to transcend, precisely because they
are treated as naturalized or biologically fixed by the systems we inhabit.

- Race / Ethnicity
- Gender Identity
- Sexual Orientation
- Socioeconomic Class
- Disability / Neurodivergence
- Age
- Religion / Belief System
- Nationality / Citizenship
- Language / Accent
- Body Size / Fatness
- Education Level / Academic Capital
- Immigration Status
- Indigeneity / Settler Status
- Geographic Location (urban/rural, Global North/South)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These dimensions are being critically explored and increasingly acknowledged
as significant to understanding layered identity and systemic bias.

- Skin Tone / Colorism (intra-racial hierarchy)
- Mental Health Status

- Digital Access / Tech Literacy
- Hair Texture / Cultural Aesthetics
- Cultural Capital (familiarity with dominant norms & tastes)

of power, domination, and resistance across identity intersections.
